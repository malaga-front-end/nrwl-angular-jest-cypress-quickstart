# Chapter 1: Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before creating the application, you need to install some tools.

### Git

If you are using Mac OS, and you have installed XCode, Git may already be installed. To find out, open a terminal and enter ``git version``.

If that's not the case, or you have a different OS, follow the instructions here for your favourite OS:

### NodeJS

Download LTS version of NodeJS. With this we will be able to use Node Package Manager (npm).

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Packages that will make your life easier

### Angular CLI

The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that you use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications. You can use the tool directly in a command shell, or indirectly through an interactive UI such as Angular Console.

Install the CLI using the ``npm`` package manager:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Nx: 

Nx is a set of extensible dev tools for monorepos. With Nx, you can:

* Use modern tools like Cypress, Jest, Prettier, TypeScript, and others.
* Build full-stack applications using Angular, and Node.js.
* Use effective development practices pioneered at Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.

Install Nx using ``npm``package manager:

```
npm install -g nx
```

## Getting Started

### Create your workspace

```
npx create-nx-workspace@latest
```

You will need to answer a few questions to setup your application:

* Workspace name? myapp
* What to create in the new workspace? angular (a workspace with a single angular application)
* Application Name? myapp
* Default stylesheet format? CSS
* Use Nx Cloud? No

It will start to download and setup your initial app. Jest (Unit testing) and Cypress (E2E) dependencies will be automatically added.

### Serving application

After initial setup, you only need to serve your application to start working!

```
ng serve
```

Go to http://localhost:4200 to see the initial app that Nx has prepared for you.

To execute the unit tests of the application:

```
ng test
```

To execute the e2e tests of the application:

```
ng e2e myapp-e2e
```

After installing all needed tools, you're ready to start creating your app!
