# Create your Angular app and test it with Jest and Cypress

## Introduction

This tutorial wants to be an introduction to some of the modern tools that makes developers' life easier. We will make an overview of:

 - Angular CLI 
 - Nx
 - Jest
 - Cypress

 We will develop a small application, creating its workspace with Nx, and generating its components and services with Angular CLI. After communicating its components via a shared service, we will review the Front End Testing Pyramid to know what type of tests we should do to properly test the application. We will unit test its services and components, showing how easy is mocking with Jest. After that, we will use this tool to develop snapshot tests for the components. To finish our tutorial, we will check that all together is working properly: we will create our first E2E test with Cypress.

 This tutorial is divided in the following chapters:

- [Chapter 1: Getting Started](./tutorial/chapter-1-getting-started)
- [Chapter 2: Developing our app](./tutorial/chapter-2-developing-our-app)
- [Chapter 3: The Front End Testing Pyramid](./tutorial/chapter-3-the-fe-testing-pyramid)
- [Chapter 4: Unit and snapshot testing with Jest](./tutorial/chapter-4-unit-and-snapshot-testing-with-jest)
- [Chapter 5: E2E testing with Cypress](./tutorial/chapter-5-e2e-testing-with-cypress)

Enjoy!
